<div>Hi there!  I'm a software developer from Boston who specializes in front-end technologies and dabbles in back-end ones.  In my code I try to emphasize modularity, readability, and maintainability.  Some tools I love are GitHub, SASS, Node.js, and Gulp.  And if I met jQuery in a bar, I'd buy it a drink.</div>
<div class="with-top-margin">I'm happily employed at <a href="http://vitalsource.com/">VitalSource Technologies</a> and am not seeking new career opportunities.  But feel free to contact me about open-source or community volunteer projects.</div>
